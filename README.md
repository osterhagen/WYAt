# WYAt
Where You At:
WYAt, or Where You At, is an app that allows Resident Assistant’s (RA) to communicate efficiently with residents. 
Through the WYAt app the RA can update their status and the students can see the status at a moments notice via 
website or an LCD display outside the RA’s door. This will ensure that RA's will be able to share their whereabouts 
and anything else at ease and residents will have access to any important information at their fingertips.
